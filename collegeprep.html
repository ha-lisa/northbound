    <h2>Objective</h2>

    <p>Junior year! Many say that this is the most difficult year because it is the one colleges will see the grades and activities you have already done. For this year, you want to get the best grades you possibly can and start planning to apply to colleges starting the summer or afterwards.</p>

      <li>Continue exploring majors and gaining relevant experience to your interested majors.</li>
      <li>Continue attending sponsored events/conferences at univerisities/colleges.</li>
      <li>Continue applying for scholarships. Especially do the essay scholarships- the essays you write for them will be very useful when you are applying to colleges and senior-specific scholarships next year!</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>My advice (as a senior rn):</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Start your college list, Coalition, and Common App profiles early! Inputting all 4 year’s worth of classes is a pain to do a lot a lot of times over different platforms ;-; .</li>
      <li>With your college list already started, check to see if you need to take SAT Subject Tests. Also on that note, take your SATs or ACTs early so you don’t need to stress about them in senior year (summer is good if possible).</li>
      <li>In addition to the FAFSA, there’s a thing called the CSS Profile on CollegeBoard which is basically the more difficult version of the FAFSA. I’ve noticed international and prestigious U.S. schools (i.e. most if not all of Questbridge’s college partners) require both or at least the CSS. Check on your list to see if you also need to do the CSS Profile!</li>
      <li>Apply to a bunch of scholarships especially ones that require essays so that you can evolve great personal essays by the time you’re an old senior.</li>
      <li>Apply to Questbridge College Prep Scholars and start early. There are a ton of essays in it that you can’t write well in a night :/ Then in senior year, you can apply to Questbridge National College Match with like all the essays already written because they re-use questions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>More things to do:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Take the SAT.</li>
      <li>Sign up to take AP/IB exams if applicable.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>What you need to do</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Continue taking academically challenging courses and MAINTAIN your grades!</li>
    <li>Continue doing clubs/sports, volunteering, working at a job/internship and/or do other extracurricular activities. Continue documenting it and take up leadership positions in your activities.</li>
    <li>Continue planning/attending sponsored events/conferences at univerisities/colleges.</li>
    <li>Continue applying for scholarships. This is the year for those senior-specific scholarships!</li>
    <li>Register for the FAFSA/WAFSA ASAP when it opens (Create your FAFSA ID before it opens and have all your information ready to go).</li>
    <li>Lastly, have the TIME of your HIGH SCHOOL LIFE! It's senior season, so don't forget to maintain your friendships with your teachers and peers before you graduate and have less opportunities to see them.</li>
