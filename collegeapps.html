    <h2>Applying to College</h2>

    <p>Every college require different things. Some require letters of recommendations, SAT Subject Test scores, portfolios, interviews, etc. and some do not. Researching the colleges you want to attend is important.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Complete all the testing you need to do (SAT/ACT, SAT Subject Tests, AP, IB, TOEFL etc.). Do the SAT/ACT at least month before the deadline on college applications! This will save a lot of stress.</li>
      <li>Finish writing your personal statement and have it reviewed by multiple people.</li>
      <li>Complete your <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/">Common Application</a> and/or <a href="https://applyweb.collegenet.com/account/new/create?origin=https://www.mycoalition.org/app">Coalition</a> profiles if you are applying to colleges that are on those platforms.</li>
      <li>Decide on which colleges to apply for (go for at least 4, include at least a safe school, a target school, and a dream school) and finish those applications! You can often get fee waivers for those applications.</li>
    </ul>
