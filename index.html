      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>There are many options and pathways you can take after you graduate high school. College is only one of those pathways. Some go into apprenticeships, the military, or begin working right away. That being said, this website is focused solely on the pathway of college.</p>

      <p>This is what a college education can do for you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>More opportunities and access to networks and resources.</li>
        <li>Be more a more appealing applicant when applying to jobs.</li>
        <li>Be more eligible for applying to more jobs.</li>
        <li>Be paid more than someone who only has their high school diploma.</li>
        <li>Have networks in the industry to support you in your career.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When applying, it is important to note that <strong>colleges review applications <em>holistically.</em></strong> This means that they are taking multiple factors into account and don't put more weight/importance on one factor than another. Your grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities are all important, but one is not worth more over another meaning that your test scores or grades alone will not break your application.</p>

    <div class="section" id="coursework">

      <h2>Coursework</h2>

        <p>Taking challenging courses and earning good grades looks good to colleges because they can see that you have the capabilities to succeed on their campus. It shows that you are proactive and have a strong work ethic.</p>

        <p>There are many types of advanced classes offered in the United States. It depends on your school on which of these classes are offered. Some types may be a better fit for you than others and each have their advantages/disadvantages. It all depends on the student.</p>

        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Even if your school does not offer many advanced or the types of classes you need to take to fulfill a college application requirement, you can still do 2 things: <em>(1) Seek out outside resources and opportunities OUTSIDE what your school offers.</em> This is good because it shows to colleges that you are resourceful and proactive. You can find resources to help you seek out these opportunities <a href="#resources">here.</a> <em>(2) In the "additional information" section of college applications, you can explain your situation, so that the college admissions person can see your transcript in context of what you were able to take in your school.</em></p>

        <h3>Advanced Classes Types</h3>

          <p><strong>AP (Advanced Placement):</strong> You can earn college credit if you take AP tests (scoring is on a scale of 1-5). Different colleges require different scores.</p>

          <p><strong>IB (International Baccalaureate):</strong> You can also earn college credit through IB testing (scale is on a scale of 1-7).</p>

          <p>In addition to taking IB classes, you have the option of enrolling in the two-year full IB Diploma program for your junior and senior years. This is different from taking IB classes because there are extra components you have to complete such as the EE (a 4000-word extended essay), CAS hours (creativity, activity, service hours), and TOK (theory of knowledge class). You are required to take 3 SL (standard level) and 3 HL (higher level) classes. Some benefits of being a full IB Diploma candidate is that you are competitive when applying to colleges, you are allowed to have some classes waivered, and you have a specialized support system and network of peers who have strong ambitions as you do.</p>

          <p><strong>Running Start:</strong> You can choose to enroll in a Running Start program and work towards earning your AA degree at a college while you are still a high schooler.</p>

          <p><strong>Dual enrollment:</strong> You can decide to earn college credit while taking still classes in high school.</p>

          <p><strong>Honors:</strong> These classes are advanced versions of the regular/core classes.</p>

  <div class="section" id="testing">

    <h2>Testing</h2>

      <p>Most colleges required SAT/ACT scores. Some also want SAT Subject Test scores, depending on the college. You will register for the SAT on the <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat">College Board website</a> and the ACT on the <a href="https://www.act.org/">ACT website.</a></p>

      <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Colleges will "superscore" your SAT test scores. This means that they will take your highest reading and math scores from the SAT tests you have already taken instead of the overall score.</p>

      <p><strong>ALSO IMPORTANT:</strong> The SAT waivers are good for 2 SAT tests and 6 Subject Tests!!! Use them if you have them!</p>

    <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>

    <p>Doing extracurricular activities and talking about them on your college applications are really important. It is one of the factors that colleges take into account when reviewing your application.</p>

    <p>There are lots of things you can put for extracurricular activities on your college and scholarship applications including nontraditional ones that may not happen at school. Extracurricular activities mean anything that you do outside of your classes.</p>

    <p>Some examples of extracurricular activities:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clubs (You can start your own club, too!)</li>
      <li>Sports</li>
      <li>Volunteering</li>
      <li>Work/job</li>
      <li>Family responsibilities (for example, babysitting)</li>
      <li>Hobbies</li>
      <li>Summer programs/Pre-college</li>
      <li>Camps</li>
